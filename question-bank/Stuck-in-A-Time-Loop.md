# Stuck in A Time Loop

Last night, as you snuggled into bed, you had this funny feeling that tomorrow might be the same as today. And guess what? When you woke up, everyone thought it was yesterday morning all over again! The same funny feeling stuck around when the sun went down.

After this kept happening for a bunch of days, you decided to ask a friendly time wizard for help. The wizard told you a cool secret: he could help you escape the time loop with a special spell. All you had to do was count to a magic number, starting from zero, and say "Abracadabra" with each count. Let the magical adventure begin!
